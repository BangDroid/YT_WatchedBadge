 # YT_WatchedBadge
Replaces the red progress bar on thumbnails with a "Watched" cover that disappears on hover.

Compatible with YouTube's own light and dark themes, no guarantees for other userstyle custom themes. But provided they leave the progress bar alone (&lt;ytd-thumbnail-overlay-resume-playback-renderer&gt; and children, it shouldn't be an issue.)
The userstyle includes a baked in image as encoded base64 string so it's quite large but removes external dependencies on other hosts.
